## The Problem Section

### Headline
**Most Innovations Fail. Here's Why.**

### Body Copy
Every day, brilliant ideas die because they lack structure, validation, and proper analysis. Entrepreneurs and product managers struggle with:

- **Where to Start**: Overwhelming ambiguity in transforming ideas into actionable plans
- **Market Blind Spots**: Missing critical competitive intelligence or market trends
- **Financial Uncertainty**: No clear path to profitability or investment requirements
- **Pitch paralysis**: Unable to synthesize everything into compelling presentations

**The result?** 90% of startups fail, and corporate innovation initiatives rarely return on investment.

But what if you had a proven framework—the same path followed by Tesla, Nest, DJI, and other breakthrough companies?
