    uid=47_0 StaticText "Welcome! I'm here to help you define your innovation challenge. Let's start by understanding what problem you're trying to solve. What challenge or opportunity are you exploring?"
    uid=47_1 StaticText "Small businesses struggle to manage their inventory effectively, leading to stockouts and lost sales"
    uid=47_2 StaticText "That’s a very common and costly issue. It sounds like the core struggle is the "
    uid=47_3 StaticText "lack of effective inventory management"
    uid=47_4 StaticText ", which directly hits the bottom line through "
    uid=47_5 StaticText "stockouts and lost revenue"
    uid=47_6 StaticText "."
    uid=47_7 StaticText "Is there a specific reason why they are struggling right now?"
    uid=47_8 StaticText "Is it a lack of time?"
    uid=47_9 StaticText "Are they using outdated tools like pen and paper?"
    uid=47_10 StaticText "Or is it just too complex to manage across different locations?"
    uid=47_11 StaticText "Help me understand the root cause a bit better."
    uid=47_12 StaticText "Small retail businesses and local shops that sell physical products, typically with 1-10 employees and annual revenue under $1M"
    uid=47_13 StaticText "Got it, thanks for clarifying that. It sounds like the "
    uid=47_14 StaticText "problem"
    uid=47_15 StaticText " is the struggle to manage inventory effectively, which leads to stockouts and lost sales. Does that capture it accurately? If so, let's move on to understand who faces this problem."
    uid=47_16 StaticText "Currently use spreadsheets and manual counting, or legacy POS systems that are expensive and complicated for small businesses"
    uid=47_17 StaticText "Great, that fills in the picture on the "
    uid=47_18 StaticText "why"
    uid=47_19 StaticText "."
    uid=47_20 StaticText "So the core challenge is that "
    uid=47_21 StaticText "small retail businesses struggle to manage inventory effectively"
    uid=47_22 StaticText ", leading to "
    uid=47_23 StaticText "stockouts and lost sales"
    uid=47_24 StaticText ". This is largely driven by their reliance on "
    uid=47_25 StaticText "manual methods like spreadsheets"
    uid=47_26 StaticText " or "
    uid=47_27 StaticText "legacy POS systems that are too expensive and complex"
    uid=47_28 StaticText " for their needs."
    uid=47_29 StaticText "Does that accurately summarize the problem you're looking to solve?"
    uid=47_30 StaticText "Yes, that's correct for Problem Statement."
    uid=47_31 StaticText "Excellent, now let's move on to the "
    uid=47_32 StaticText "Target Audience"
    uid=47_33 StaticText "."
    uid=47_34 StaticText "You mentioned "
    uid=47_35 StaticText "small retail businesses and local shops"
    uid=47_36 StaticText " with "
    uid=47_37 StaticText "1-10 employees"
    uid=47_38 StaticText " and "
    uid=47_39 StaticText "under $1M in revenue"
    uid=47_40 StaticText "."
    uid=47_41 StaticText "To get a clearer picture, are we focusing on a specific type of retail, or is this broad across all physical product sellers? For example:"
    uid=47_42 StaticText "Fashion and apparel boutiques?"
    uid=47_43 StaticText "Specialty food and beverage shops?"
    uid=47_44 StaticText "Hardware or home goods stores?"
    uid=47_45 StaticText "Help me narrow down who specifically we are targeting."
    uid=47_46 StaticText "Specialty food and beverage shops - cafes, bakeries, and gourmet food stores that need to track perishable items"
    uid=47_47 StaticText "That adds a really important layer of complexity. Tracking "
    uid=47_48 StaticText "perishable items"
    uid=47_49 StaticText " changes the game entirely compared to selling durable goods, as spoilage becomes a major factor alongside stockouts."
    uid=47_50 StaticText "So, your "
    uid=47_51 StaticText "Target Audience"
    uid=47_52 StaticText " consists of:"
    uid=47_53 StaticText "Specialty food and beverage shops"
    uid=47_54 StaticText " (cafes, bakeries, gourmet food stores)"
    uid=47_55 StaticText "With "

    uid=47_59 StaticText "Specifically those that need to manage "
    uid=47_60 StaticText "perishable inventory"
    uid=47_61 StaticText "Does this accurately define who you are building for?"
    uid=47_62 StaticText "Yes, that's correct for Target Audience."
    uid=47_63 StaticText "Perfect. Now let's look at the "
    uid=47_64 StaticText "Existing Solutions"
    uid=47_65 StaticText "."
    uid=47_66 StaticText "You've already mentioned that these shops currently rely on:"
    uid=47_67 StaticText "Spreadsheets and manual counting"
    uid=47_68 StaticText "Legacy POS systems"
    uid=47_69 StaticText " that are expensive and complicated"
    uid=47_70 StaticText "Beyond these, what other approaches have you seen them try?"
    uid=47_71 StaticText "Do they use any mobile apps specifically for inventory?"
    uid=47_72 StaticText "Do some just "eyeball" it and order based on gut feeling?"
    uid=47_73 StaticText "Are there any competitors in this space that they've tried and rejected?"
    uid=47_74 StaticText "I want to understand what else is out there and why it isn't working for them."
    uid=47_75 StaticText "Some try generic inventory apps but they're too complex, others just order based on gut feeling. Many don't trust expensive software after trying free trials"
    uid=47_76 StaticText "That paints a clear picture of the gaps in the current market."
    uid=47_77 StaticText "So, the "
    uid=47_78 StaticText "Existing Solutions"
    uid=47_79 StaticText " landscape looks like this:"
    uid=47_80 StaticText "Spreadsheets and manual counting"
    uid=47_81 StaticText " (Time-consuming, error-prone)"
    uid=47_82 StaticText "Legacy POS systems"

    uid=47_86 StaticText "Gut feeling ordering"
    uid=47_87 StaticText " (Unreliable, leads to waste or shortages)"
    uid=47_88 StaticText "It seems like the trust is broken because existing tools are either built for massive operations or aren't designed with the specific workflow of a perishable-focused shop in mind."
