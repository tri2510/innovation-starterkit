    uid=40_1 StaticText "Small businesses struggle to manage their inventory effectively, leading to stockouts and lost sales"
    uid=40_2 StaticText "That’s a very common and costly issue. It sounds like the core struggle is the "
    uid=40_3 StaticText "lack of effective inventory management"
    uid=40_4 StaticText ", which directly hits the bottom line through "
    uid=40_5 StaticText "stockouts and lost revenue"
    uid=40_6 StaticText "."
    uid=40_7 StaticText "Is there a specific reason why they are struggling right now?"
    uid=40_8 StaticText "Is it a lack of time?"
    uid=40_9 StaticText "Are they using outdated tools like pen and paper?"
    uid=40_10 StaticText "Or is it just too complex to manage across different locations?"
    uid=40_11 StaticText "Help me understand the root cause a bit better."
    uid=40_12 StaticText "Small retail businesses and local shops that sell physical products, typically with 1-10 employees and annual revenue under $1M"
    uid=40_13 StaticText "Got it, thanks for clarifying that. It sounds like the "
    uid=40_14 StaticText "problem"
    uid=40_15 StaticText " is the struggle to manage inventory effectively, which leads to stockouts and lost sales. Does that capture it accurately? If so, let's move on to understand who faces this problem."
    uid=40_16 StaticText "Currently use spreadsheets and manual counting, or legacy POS systems that are expensive and complicated for small businesses"
    uid=40_17 StaticText "Great, that fills in the picture on the "
    uid=40_18 StaticText "why"
    uid=40_19 StaticText "."
    uid=40_20 StaticText "So the core challenge is that "
    uid=40_21 StaticText "small retail businesses struggle to manage inventory effectively"
    uid=40_22 StaticText ", leading to "
    uid=40_23 StaticText "stockouts and lost sales"
    uid=40_24 StaticText ". This is largely driven by their reliance on "
    uid=40_25 StaticText "manual methods like spreadsheets"
    uid=40_26 StaticText " or "
    uid=40_27 StaticText "legacy POS systems that are too expensive and complex"
    uid=40_28 StaticText " for their needs."
    uid=40_29 StaticText "Does that accurately summarize the problem you're looking to solve?"
    uid=40_30 StaticText "Yes, that's correct for Problem Statement."
    uid=40_31 StaticText "Excellent, now let's move on to the "
    uid=40_32 StaticText "Target Audience"
    uid=40_33 StaticText "."
    uid=40_34 StaticText "You mentioned "
    uid=40_35 StaticText "small retail businesses and local shops"
    uid=40_36 StaticText " with "
    uid=40_37 StaticText "1-10 employees"
    uid=40_38 StaticText " and "
    uid=40_39 StaticText "under $1M in revenue"
    uid=40_40 StaticText "."
    uid=40_41 StaticText "To get a clearer picture, are we focusing on a specific type of retail, or is this broad across all physical product sellers? For example:"
    uid=40_42 StaticText "Fashion and apparel boutiques?"
    uid=40_43 StaticText "Specialty food and beverage shops?"
    uid=40_44 StaticText "Hardware or home goods stores?"
    uid=40_45 StaticText "Help me narrow down who specifically we are targeting."
    uid=40_46 StaticText "Specialty food and beverage shops - cafes, bakeries, and gourmet food stores that need to track perishable items"
    uid=40_47 StaticText "That adds a really important layer of complexity. Tracking "
    uid=40_48 StaticText "perishable items"
    uid=40_49 StaticText " changes the game entirely compared to selling durable goods, as spoilage becomes a major factor alongside stockouts."
    uid=40_50 StaticText "So, your "
    uid=40_51 StaticText "Target Audience"
    uid=40_52 StaticText " consists of:"
    uid=40_53 StaticText "Specialty food and beverage shops"

    uid=40_62 StaticText "Yes, that's correct for Target Audience."

    uid=40_67 StaticText "Spreadsheets and manual counting"
    uid=40_68 StaticText "Legacy POS systems"
    uid=40_69 StaticText " that are expensive and complicated"
    uid=40_70 StaticText "Beyond these, what other approaches have you seen them try?"
    uid=40_71 StaticText "Do they use any mobile apps specifically for inventory?"
    uid=40_72 StaticText "Do some just "eyeball" it and order based on gut feeling?"
