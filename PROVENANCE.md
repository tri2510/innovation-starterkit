## Originality Statement

This Innovation Starterkit represents my original idea and concept for using AI-powered guided workflows to democratize the innovation process. I conceived this idea independently and developed this Proof of Concept/MVP to demonstrate its feasibility.

**Original Work:** https://github.com/tri2510/innovation-kit/

### My Original Contribution

**Core Innovation:** A wizard-based application that uses AI assistance to guide users through a structured innovation process:

1. **Challenge** - Define problems and target audience
2. **Market** - Analyze trends and competition
3. **Ideation** - Generate and refine business ideas
4. **Investment** - Financial analysis and ROI evaluation
5. **Pitch** - Create compelling presentations

This was my original concept for leveraging Large Language Models to make professional innovation methodologies accessible to everyone.

### Why This Is Original

- **Novel Application**: Applying AI wizard pattern to innovation workflows
- **Integration Design**: Unique combination of AI streaming, step-by-step guidance, and document generation
- **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure of complexity through conversational interface
- **End-to-End Vision**: Complete idea-to-pitch workflow in one application
